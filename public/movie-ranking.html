<h3>~ Spirited Away ~</h3>
    <p>
        The movie is about a young girl named Chihiro who wonders into the world of the gods and spirits. <br /> 
        She is forced to work at a bathhouse as her parents get turned into pigs by the evil witch Yubaba.

        The movie itself is very beautiful and the art work is a masterpiece, if you are a anime fan. <br /> 
        The story telling is great and fun to follow.

<h3>~ A Silent Voice ~</h3>
    <p>
        The movie follows Shōya Ishida, a former bully turned social outcast, who decides to reconnect and <br /> 
        befriend the deaf girl he bullied years prior.

        When this first came out back in 2016, it was a hit with all anime fans and some who didn't watch anime <br /> 
        at all. The art work and story is what drove me into watching this movie and I won't lie, I enjoyed every part <br /> 
        of it. From how Shōya because the way he did and how he tried to redeemed itself. That being said, the story also tackles <br /> 
        many issues like, bullying, social anxiety, depression and suicide. A heartwarming and heart wrenching story.

<h3>~ The Labyrinth ~</h3>
    <p>
        Sixteen-year-old Sarah is given thirteen hours to solve a labyrinth and rescue her baby brother Toby, when her wish for him <br />
        to be taken away is granted by the Goblin King Jareth.

        What can I say, this movie is a classic. That being said, it has been some time since I last saw it. But it was a very fun <br />
        movie to watch and the humor was great too.

<h3>~ Your Name ~</h3>
    <p>
        Your Name is a touching, emotional, dramatic movie about two character, Taki and Mitsuha, who begin waking up in each other's <br /> 
        bodies every few days. They learn to work together to make both their lives as normal as possible and eventually, both attempt to <br />
        visit one another.

    <p>
      <span style="padding-left: 40px; display:block">
        Another anime movie which it's story telling and art work was out of this world. When it came out in 2016, it was something <br />
        I had to watch. There was a lot of symbolism, with the kuchikamizake and the red yarn being the most explicit.

<h3>~ Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children ~</h3>
    <p>
        Advent Children takes place two years after the events of Final Fantasy VII and focuses on the appearance of a trio that kidnaps <br />
        children infected with an unexplained disease called Geostigma. Final Fantasy VII hero Cloud Strife, suffering from the same <br />
        disease, goes to rescue the children. He discovers that the trio plan to resurrect Sephiroth using the remains of the extraterrestrial <br />
        villain Jenova, and he and his compatriots from the game fight to stop them.

      <span style="padding-left: 40px; display:block">
        For me, this movie had a place in my heart because when it came out in 2005, it was ahead in its time by a good amount <br />
        with the CGI it was able to pull off. With playing Final Fantasy 7 and starting to play FF7 Remix/Rebirth. Seeing the after <br />
        math of it all was something I was able to link up with and overall, I just enjoyed the movie. (Kinda hoped they would redo <br />
        the movie in 2024 with the new cast of Voice Actors in the Remake Game)
